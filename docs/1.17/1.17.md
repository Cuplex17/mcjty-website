In these tutorials I assume that you already know Java.
Note that you need to be familiar with more advanced concepts like generics and lambdas.

## Porting from 1.16.5 to 1.17.1

Two part tutorial explaining how to port a mod from 1.16.5 to 1.17.1:

* Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aJjI7UDHeI&ab_channel=JorritTyberghein
* Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-eQ8e4zJ8U&ab_channel=JorritTyberghein

### Steps to port a mod from 1.16 to 1.17

Thanks to gigaherz for the original version of these steps:

* Step 1: Make a copy of your 1.16 mod to a new folder or (alternatively) use GitHub to make a new branch and clone that
* Step 2: Download the Forge MDK and copy over the gradle folder and gradlew scripts from there, nothing else
* Step 3: Edit the build.gradle to use FG 5.1+:

```gradle title="build.gradle"
classpath group: 'net.minecraftforge.gradle', name: 'ForgeGradle', version: '5.1.+', changing: true
```

* Step 4: Open a cmd window or bash shell (for Linux) with java16 in the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH`. Check with `java -version` that you really switched
* Step 5: If your 1.16.5 mod is not using official mappings then run:

```shell
gradlew -PUPDATE_MAPPINGS=1.16.5 -PUPDATE_MAPPINGS_CHANNEL=official updatemappings
```

* Step 6: Edit the build.gradle mappings line `mappings channel: 'official', version: '1.16.5'` [THIS IS IMPORTANT!!]

```gradle title="build.gradle"
mappings channel: 'official', version: '1.16.5'
```

* Step 7: Add the following line to your build.gradle:

```gradle title="build.gradle"
apply from: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SizableShrimp/Forge-Class-Remapper/main/classremapper.gradle'
```

* Step 8: Run the gradle command to update class names:

```shell
gradlew -PUPDATE_CLASSNAMES=true updateClassnames
```

* Step 9: Change the `build.gradle` mappings line to `mappings channel: 'official', version: '1.17.1'`:

```gradle title="build.gradle"
mappings channel: 'official', version: '1.17.1'
```

* Step 10: Change the `sourceCompability = ... = '1.8'`  to `'16'`
* Step 11: Change the forge dependency to minecraft `net.minecraftforge:forge:1.17.1-37.1.1` [USE LATEST HERE, .1 WAS LATEST AT THE TIME OF WRITING]

```gradle title="build.gradle"
minecraft 'net.minecraftforge:forge:1.17.1-37.1.1'
```

* Step 12: Import into Intellij, changing Intellij's project SDK to java16, and making use the gradle JRE uses the project JDK too
* Step 13: Run `gradlew genIntellijRuns`
* Step 14+: Fix code and test

## The New Tutorial Series

In this new series we start a new 1.17.1 tutorial from scratch.
The previous porting tutorials focused on porting the existing old tutorial to 1.17.1.
But if you are new and want to learn modding from scratch then this is the place to be

### Episode One: Mod setup and first item

In this episode we show how to set up your project using IntelliJ.
We start from the MDK and initialize everything, so you can start modding.

We also create the very first primitive item.

Concepts learned in this tutorial:

* Events and the forge + mod buses
* Setup events
* Registration of items (and other things) and when this registration happens

### Episode Two: expanding on our item

Here we fully flesh out the item we added in the previous tutorial:

* A nice model (one that can change based on a property in the item)
* Some functionality (a pickaxe with extra features)
* A nice tooltip and a translatable name
* A recipe

Concepts learned in this tutorial:

* Difference between Item (singleton) and ItemStack (an actual item in the game)
* Item properties
* JSON models and recipes
* Data generation (creating JSON files)
* Minecraft API
* Translatable messages
* Client setup

### Episode Three: making a power generator

In this episode we make a power generator (generating Forge Energy) that takes burnable items and converts them to energy:

* The block can generate power (Forge Energy) from burnable items (coal, sticks, ...)
* The generator has a distinct front face which will change if it is generating power
* It will emit light when it is generating power
* It has a gui

Concepts learned in this tutorial:

* Blocks and BlockStates (with properties)
* Block Entities
* Capabilities (for power and items)
* Generating Forge Energy
* Data generation for loot, blockstate models and tags
* Containers and Screens

### Episode Four: making a machine that uses power

This is a small tutorial that expands on the previous one.
In this episode we make a machine that can use the Forge Energy generated by the generator from episode 3.

Concepts learned in this tutorial:

* Using Forge Energy
* Render layers
* Server -> Client communication for block entities

### Episode Five: updating Forge, Parchment and Configuration

This tutorial starts by updating Forge and fixing the tool for a breaking change.
We also start using Parchment to get better mappings for parameter names.
Finally, we conclude by explaining how to add configuration to your mod.

Parchment: [Parchment explanation](https://github.com/ParchmentMC/Librarian/blob/dev/docs/FORGEGRADLE.md)

Concepts learned in this tutorial:

* Updating Forge
* Parchment
* Three types of config (COMMON, SERVER, and CLIENT)
* Registration BEFORE configuration!
