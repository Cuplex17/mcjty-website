# Links

Here are links to other sites that contain useful information related to modding on Minecraft:

* [https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample | Many examples in code form. Easy to use as a start for your own blocks and items]
* [http://mcforge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ | The official Forge documentation. Very well written and good explanation on various subjects]
* [http://www.minecraftforge.net/wiki/Main_Page | Another official wiki with forge documentation. Not up-to-date]
