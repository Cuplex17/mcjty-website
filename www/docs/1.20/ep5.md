## Introduction

This tutorial continues on episode 4. In that episode we added a power generator and also a block
that will consume power. You can already let the generator give power to the charger if you place
them next to each other. However, we don't have a way to transport power over a distance yet.
In this tutorial we will add a simple cable system that can transport power from any generator
or battery to any machine that needs power. This is not a perfect cable system. It is just a
simple system that will work for our purposes.

* Baked models
* Custom model loader
* Complex block shape
