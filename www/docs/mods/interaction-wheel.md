# Interaction Wheel

## Introduction

This mod adds an interactive Interaction Wheel that you can access by pressing `x` (default key).
It supports various actions that you can easily access directly from that wheel.

Some examples are:

* Search the item in your hand in nearby inventories
* Rotate block
* Dump all items in inventory (with or without hotbar)
* Fetch all items from inventory
* Dump all similar items to inventory
* Switch to the appropriate tool to harvest the block you're looking at
* Pick up a block from RFTools or similar
* Resize an RFTools screen
* And much more

It is possible to reconfigure the wheel in game (press the little wheel icon in the center). You can:

* Assign hotkeys to actions. These hotkeys don't interfere with other hotkeys as they are only active while the wheel is open
* Hide actions you never use
