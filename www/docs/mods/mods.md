## Lets Plays

McJty has two Lets Plays where he often uses his own mods (and others).
The first one is technical and uses mods like RFTools, Deep Resonance, and so on: [McJty Plays 1.10.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmaTwVFUUXiBCCPMobixs2WZxpY9f0JvM)

The second one is a very hard modpack where surviving it just about the most that he can manage to get done... almost...: [The Struggle](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmaTwVFUUXiDUEgTpRj5_sz_03BlmMUbj)

Here is the [Mod List](./struggle-mod-list.md) for the Struggle.
